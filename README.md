FACTs shutdown checklist website

This is the code for the shutdown checklist website of the FACT telescope.
It:

 - reminds shifters of what to do during shutdown.
 - sends a mail to everybody, when the shutdown was done.
 - sends a mail to a dedicated checker person for crosschecking the shutdown.
 - puts a timestamp into a DB table, so the shifthelper can see, there was a shutdown done recently.
